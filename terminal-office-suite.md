# Putting the office suite in the terminal with Markdown

## Why?

1. Terminal apps are lighter, thus they work better on lower end computers. You don't have to take a truck to go to the shop for milk.
2. Terminal apps are almost always free unlike normal office suites (some of which cost over 100â‚¬!)
3. Terminal apps are very customisable and easily made to fit your specific needs.
4. Many GUI office suites require internet access for full functionality/documentation, whilst most terminal apps do not.
